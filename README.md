# Fetch ADO(Azure DevOps) Data

GAS-made code to copy data from another project in Azure DevOps.

Requires an area path and iteration path named "Copied" in the destination project.

Not yet supported for copying attachments and other details.

Since I rarely write TypeScript, and since I created it in a very hurry, the code is messy and unmaintainable.

I plan to refactor it when I have time, but the schedule is undecided.
